    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Learn how to make scrambled eggs in a pan with this easy, foolproof recipe. This speedy breakfast is packed with protein and takes just 10 minutes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>2 large free range eggs</li>
        <li>6 tbsp single cream</li>
        <li>a knob of butter</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>

        <li>Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency.</li>
        <li>Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Do not allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs.</li>
        <li>Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.</li>
        <li>Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.</li>
        <li>Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.</li>

    </ol>
