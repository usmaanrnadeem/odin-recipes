    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Here is how to cook steak like a chef, pan seared and basted with garlic thyme butter! It is dramatic, simple cooking at its best, you will look like a total pro and feel like you are dining at the best steakhouse in town...</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>1/2 boneless ribeye or scotch fillet</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>75g / 5 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme or 3 sprigs rosemary</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>

        <li><strong>Bring to Room Temp:</strong> Take the steak out of the fridge 30 minutes prior to bring to room temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry Steaks:</strong> Pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat Skillet:</strong> Heat oil in a heavy based skillet over high heat until it is very hot, you should see smoke!</li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong>Sprinkle each side of the steak generously with salt and pepper, then immediately place in the skillet.</li>
        <li><strong>Sear Side 1:</strong>Cook for 2/2.5 minutes until you get a great crust, then turn.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic Butter:</strong>Leave for 1 minute, then push steaks to one side and toss in butter, garlic and thyme.</li>
        <li><strong>Baste:</strong>As soon as the butter is melted, continuously spoon the butter over the steak until it is cooked to your liking, 2 minutes in total for the 2nd side for medium rare (52C/125F, chart below for other doneness temps)</li>
        <li>Basting also renders fat on the side of the steak, use tongs to sear the edges at the end if you want it browned more.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest:</strong>Transfer steak to a plate and cover loosely with foil, rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>steak with a bit of the butter from the skillet drizzled on top. Pictured in post with Crispy Smashed Potatoes.</li>
